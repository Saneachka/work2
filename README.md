# Fashion MNIST Image Classification
This project performs image classification on the Fashion MNIST dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with Keras. The dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images of 10 different types of clothing, making it a suitable introduction to CNNs for visual classification tasks.

Project Overview
The Fashion MNIST dataset includes:

10 Classes: T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, Ankle boot.
Training Set: 60,000 images.
Test Set: 10,000 images.
The project follows these steps to build an accurate model:

Steps
Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Normalize pixel values of images to the [0,1] range.
Perform reshaping and scaling on the image data for CNN compatibility.
Model Creation:

Define a CNN architecture using Keras.
Layers include convolutional, pooling, dropout, and dense layers to extract relevant features and reduce overfitting.
Model Training:

Train the model on the training set with an appropriate optimizer (e.g., Adam) and loss function (categorical cross-entropy).
Use validation data to monitor training progress and adjust hyperparameters if needed.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the trained model on the test set.
Measure accuracy and loss to understand the model's performance on unseen data.
Visualization:

Plot training and validation accuracy/loss over epochs to visualize learning trends.
Optionally, create a confusion matrix to analyze per-class performance.
Conclusions:

Discuss model accuracy and areas for improvement.
Summarize key learnings and future enhancements.

Usage
Download the Fashion MNIST dataset.
Run the script to load data, preprocess it, and train the model.
Results
Accuracy: The model aims to achieve high accuracy by leveraging CNN layers to recognize subtle differences between clothing items.
Loss: Tracks model performance and helps identify potential overfitting.
This project provides a foundational example of using CNNs for grayscale image classification with Keras. It can serve as a starting point for more advanced image classification projects.
